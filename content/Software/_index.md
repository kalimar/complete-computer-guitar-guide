# The Software

The digital signal chain generally consists of digital effects => amp simulator => speaker simulator => digital rack effects. Two common ways to achieve this are:

1. An all-in-one solution
2. A digital audio workstation (DAW)

Later in the guide we will cover hybrid signal chains with analog effects, analog amps, load boxes, etc.
